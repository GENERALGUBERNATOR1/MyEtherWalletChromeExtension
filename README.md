### 1/24/2016 THIS IS CURRENTLY UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT. DO NOT USE OR ATTEMPT TO USE - IT WON'T WORK ANYWAYS. ANTICIPATING A LAUNCH BY 1/31/2016.

### MyEtherWallet Chrome Extension / MyEtherWallet CX

This is a companion project to [MyEtherWallet.com](https://www.myetherwallet.com) - an open source, javascript, client-side tool for generating Ether wallets. [github link](https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet).

Both projects were created, and are maintained, by [kvhnuke](https://github.com/kvhnuke) and [tayvano](https://github.com/tayvano) aka [insomniasexx](https://www.reddit.com/user/insomniasexx).

### Purpose

The original purpose of MyEtherWallet.com was to provide a simple, user-friendly way for users to generate wallets, import pre-sale wallet files, and send transactions in a safe way. For the past 6 months, it has been used successfully (by more people than we ever imagined) to transfer ether, print paper wallets, and move funds from exchanges into cold storage.

Our purpose has always been to give people the tools they need to participate in Ethereum without extensive command-line knowledge. We also want to avoid the issue with centralized web wallets, which are notorious for exit-scams, hacks, and massive losses. Your Ether and your information should stay with you...and you shouldn't have to be a genius to be able to do that.

The MyEtherWallet Chrome Extension (MyEtherWallet CX) allows you to:
- Import wallets & generate new wallets
- Save any number wallets in your browser
- Quickly & easily send transactions from these saved wallets

It essentially takes MyEtherWallet.com, takes away the need for you to upload your wallet file everytime you want to move your Ether, while keeping your private keys and information with *you*.

### How it Works

1. First, you create a new wallet, upload an existing wallet file (presale, geth, myetherwallet), or paste your private key.

2. Then you create a PIN. This PIN is exclusive to MyEtherWallet CX and is used when you send transactions from the browser.

3. Add a nickname to your wallet. This is so you can easily differentiate between your wallets.

Your wallet is now stored in your browser. You can view it at any time and see the address, balance (in Ether, BTC, USD & EUR), and edit the nickname of the wallet.

From the Chrome Extension Icon you can initiate a QuickSend. We made this as short and easy as possible. We hope that this will inspire people to begin donating/tipping more in the Ethereum community, as we have seen with Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and the like.

QuickSend works like this:
- Select one of your saved wallets
- Enter an address you want to send Ether to
- Enter the amount to send
- Enter your PIN
- Confirm and send.

You can also use the traditional browser Send Transaction interface found on MyEtherWallet, but instead of uploading / pasting you key, you simply select your wallet.


### Development
As noted above, this extension is currently under heavy development and we hope to launch late January-early February. We welcome ideas, feedback, and comments. The easiest place to do this is via our [reddit annoucement thread]().
