          <div class="collapsePanel collapsed">
            <p>Your data is *almost certainly* safe. We store all your data (nickname, wallet address, and private key) in <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/storage" target="_blank">chrome.storage</a>. This is the same place Chrome saves your passwords. The private key is encrypted. The majority of code comes directly from MyEtherWallet.com. However, we want more people to use it in unpredictable ways before we launch-launch.</p>

          <h3> <span class="text-primary collapseButton">+</span> What / why is this Chrome Extension? </h3>
          <div class="collapsePanel collapsed">
            <p> The original purpose of MyEtherWallet.com was to provide a simple, user-friendly way for users to generate wallets, import pre-sale wallet files, and send transactions in a safe way. Since August 2015, it has been used successfully (by more people than we ever imagined) to transfer Ether, print paper wallets, move funds from exchanges into cold storage, and more.</p>
            <p>Our purpose has always been to give people the tools they need to participate in Ethereum without extensive command-line knowledge. We also want to avoid the issue with centralized web wallets, which are notorious for exit-scams, hacks, and massive losses. Your Ether and your information should stay with you...and you shouldn't have to be a technical wizard to do that.</p>
            <p>The MyEtherWallet Chrome Extension (MyEtherWallet CX) allows you to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Import wallets & generate new wallets</li>
              <li>Save any number wallets in your browser</li>
              <li>Quickly & easily send transactions from these saved wallets</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It essentially takes MyEtherWallet.com, takes away the need for you to upload your wallet file and enter your password everytime you want to move your Ether, and still keeps your private keys and information with you.</p>

          <div class="collapsePanel collapsed">
            <p> MyEtherWallet.com & MyEtherWallet CX give you the ability to generate new wallets so you can store your Ether yourself, not on an exchange. This process happens entirely on your computer, not our servers. Therefore, when you generate a new wallet, <strong> you are responsible for safely backing it up.</strong>.
            <p> If you just purchased ETH on an exchange and want to hold it safely in your own wallet, or if you are using ShapeShift to exchange another from cryptocurrency, you will need to complete the following steps. These steps are outlined in detail in the questions below. Please read them all in full. </p>
            <p> Do not hesitate to <a id="contact" class="ptabs" showId="paneContact">reach out to us</a> if you have any questions. Remember, Ether now holds real monetary value and can be a significant investment. If you do not backup your private key & password, there is no way to recover access to your wallet or the funds it holds. I do not say this to scare you, only to remind you to be diligent, read carefully, and take your time during all the steps. But, if you follow the instructions found on this page, even a non-technical person can safely hold their Ether in a wallet. </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Go here: <a href="https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet" target="_blank">https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet</a></li>

            <li>Doubleclick index.html.</li>
            <li>Generate wallet with a strong password. </li>
            <li>Save the password on the computer, using an additional layer of encryption.<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/47mcu2/what_program_do_you_use_to_encrypt_your_keystore/" target="_blank"> This thread has recommended encryption. </a></li>
            <li>Save the encrypted private key or encrypted JSON. Store it on this airgapped computer that will never access the internet ever.</li>
            <li>Save your address (no need to encrypt) as well. You will need to address to send ETH to yourself later.</li>
            <li>Copy the encrypted private keys and password and address to a USB drive. Encrypt said USB drive. <a href="http://computerbeginnersguides.com/blog/2015/09/03/encrypt-a-usb-flash-drive-with-bitlocker-in-windows-10-professional-or-enterprise/" target="_blank">Windows Instructions</a> & <a href="http://www.theinstructional.com/guides/encrypt-an-external-disk-or-usb-stick-with-a-password" target="_blank">Mac instructions.</a></li>
            <li>Write down the encrypted private key and password on separate pieces of paper. Don't print them because all the printers have insecure wifi these days and store shit and we're being ultra secure here. Triple check that you have written them down correctly. Store these papers in physically separate locations than the USB drives and airgapped computer.</li>
            <li>Go to the view wallet details tab and type in your private key / password from your piece of paper to ensure they are correct and access your wallet. Check that the address you wrote down is the same.</li>
            <li>Refresh that page. And copy/paste your private key or JSON and password from your computer or USB drive to ensure they are correct and can access your wallet. Check that the address you saved on your computer or USB is the same.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Keep in mind, you must prevent loss of the keys and password due to loss or failure of you hard drive failure, or USB drive, or piece of paper. You also must keep in mind physical loss / damage of an entire area (think fire or flood). </p>

          <div class="collapsePanel collapsed">
            <p>First, all data is saved on your computer, not our servers. It's not a website where you put your Ether and we store them for you. We just make it easy for you to save your wallet information in your browser/on your computer. Then we give you a place you to access that information and do stuff with it. I know it can be confusing, but when you look at the stuff in the Chrome Extension, you are NOT looking at stuff saved on our servers somewhere - it's all saved on your own computer.</p>
            <p> That said, it is <strong>very important</strong> that you back up all your information for any new wallets generated with MyEtherWallet CX externally (meaning not on your computer!). That way if anything happens to MyEtherWallet CX or your computer, you still have all the information necessary to access your Ether. See the above section for how to save your wallets externally.</p>
            <p> If for some reason MyEtherWallet CX disappears from the Chrome Store, you can find the source on Github and load it manually.</p>

If you or a team you know would be willing to help us out in the auditing department, please let us know. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3hh89n/could_someone_please_audit_ether_wallet/">Here is a reddit thread with another user asking for someone to audit us.</a> Reach out to us on reddit or github or <a id="contact" class="ptabs" showId="paneContact"> where ever</a>.</p>
          <p> Until someone / a group of people take the time to go through the code, here are some things to alleviate any paranoia you have:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We've been up and running since August 2015. If you search for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum+ethtrader+EtherMining+EthereumProgramming+ethereumprojects+etherpool/search?q=myetherwallet&sort=relevance&t=all" target="_blank" />"myetherwallet" on reddit</a>, you can see numerous people who use us and no complaints or reports of stolen funds.</li>
            <li>We aren't going to take your money or steal your private key(s). There is no malicious code on this site. In fact the "GENERATE WALLET" and "BULK GENERATE" tabs are completely client-side. That means that all the code is executed on <strong> your computer </strong> and it is never sent to the servers or to us or anywhere else in the magical internet land.</li>
            <li> Check the URL -- This site is being served through github and you can see the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet" target="_blank">https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet</a> to the domains: <a href="http://kvhnuke.github.io/etherwallet/" target="_blank">http://kvhnuke.github.io/etherwallet/</a> and <a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com" target="_blank">https://www.myetherwallet.com</a> (our new domain with SSL). You can verify it's hosted at github by using <a href="http://viewdns.info/dnsrecord/?domain=myetherwallet.com" target="_blank">http://viewdns.info/dnsrecord/?domain=myetherwallet.com</a> - last two A record IPs are owned by github for their custom domain hosting.</li>
            <li> For generating wallets, you can download the <a href="https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet">source code</a> by using the "DOWNLOAD ZIP" button in the aforementioned link. Then, disconnect your computer from the internet and / or move that .zip file via flash drive to an air-gapped computer. Unzip the file, double-click on "index.html", and you have the exact same thing happening on your air-gapped computer. You can now generate wallets on that computer without fear that we are stealing you heart and soul and first-born child. (Obviously, sending transactions is not going to work without the internet. Sorry!)</li>
            <li> Do a test run and check and see what network activity is happening. The easiest way for you (yes, YOU!) to do this (if you are using Chrome) is to right click on the page and click "inspect element". Now, go to the "Network" tab. Then, generate a wallet. Any wallet, any password&mdash;this is a test, remember. You will see there is no network activity. You may see something happening that looks like data:image/gif and data:image/png. Those are the QR codes being generated...on your computer...by your computer. No bytes were transferred.</li>
            <li> Now, to be safe, move over to the "Resources" tab. Here you can see all the different elements that make up a website. That includes things like the HTML (the base of what you see on the page), images (pretty pictures! Usually in .jpg, .gif, or .png format), the CSS (the stuff that makes the HTML look so pretty), the JS (the stuff that makes the HTML do other stuff, like making QR codes show up when you press Generate), Local Storage (one way of storing things on your local machine), Cookies (yum! Another way for sites to store data on your machine), and caches (yet another way to store stuff on your machine, usually to make things go faster). If you click through Local Storage, Cookies, and Cache, you will see nothing is being stored. Nothing is being saved. Refresh the page and you are back to square one.</li>
            <li> If you do not feel comfortable using this tool, then by all means, do not use it. We created this tool as a helpful way for people to generate wallets and make transactions without needing to dive into command line / geth / etc. Again, feel free to reach out to us at any of the below addresses and we will respond as quickly as possible. Thanks! </li>

      <p>An open source, javascript, client-side tool for generating Ether Wallets and sending transactions. We created this after noticing users having immense trouble setting up the Ethereum client on their computers. We hope that it'll help accomplish day to day tasks without having a fully running client or dealing with command line.
